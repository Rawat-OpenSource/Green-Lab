A comprehensive empirical study measuring the energy consumption and environmental impact of successive generations of Qwen Large Language Models during inference tasks.

## Key Research Questions
**RQ1:** How does energy consumption evolve between Qwen model releases?

**RQ2:** What inference task factors (query complexity, reasoning requirements) influence energy consumption?
